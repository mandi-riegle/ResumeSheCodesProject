            <p>
                I grew up in rural Ohio, where I went to community college and obtained
                my Associate's degree. After my husband and I got married, we moved to Delaware,
                where he was stationed for the Air Force. 
                I majored in Computer Science at Delaware State University, and when I only had one semester 
                left, we found out we had to move to Alaska for my husband's job in the military. It was very
                hard having to transfer schools. I had a toddler at the time as well; we had my daughter
                one year after we had gotten married.  
            </p>

                I ended up transferring to the University of Massachusetts (online) after our move up north was 
                complete; Not long after I started college again, we found out we were expecting my son.
                It was very difficult to finish my degree while caring for a toddler and being pregnant.
                I even worked on my homework while I was in labor! It was all worth it one year later
                when I opened a beautiful envelope that encased my bachelor's degree in Information
                Technology. It took me a long time to find my first job as a Network Specialist because
                of my resume gaps. 
                </br>
                </br>
                Honestly I didn't care for networking too much; my passion was for programming! A couple years 
                later we found out we had to move yet again for my husband's job; this time to California. 
                Thanks to Covid and moving stresses, I spent a lot of time at home with my kids out of necessity. Once again, I 
                faced a resume gap due to motherhood. That's when I discovered SheCodes :) I hope this class 
                gives me the skills to fill my resume gap with a portfolio to begin my dream career as a 
                Frontend Developer.
